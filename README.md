# MeetupApp
This is an android app developed in Kotlin. It was done as part of my first semester project at UT Austin.
The app is built around the concept of crowd sourcing. The idea was to come up with an app that would serve as a one stop shop for all events at UT. Google App engine serves as the backend for the app.
